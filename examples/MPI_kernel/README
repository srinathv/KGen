These are some example files generated by my modified KGen. They are meant
to show the kind of things that are needed to have an MPI extracted kernel.
None of this has been tested with an OpenMP code.

Makefile
- Showing the options that I'm invoking KGen with

state_callsite.f90
- need to set kgen_invoke and kgen_last_invoke to 0 to get the thing to run
- add mpi_comm_rank, mpi_comm_size, mpi_barrier
- write file per rank

verify_callsite.f90
- mpi_allreduce max on numOutTol
